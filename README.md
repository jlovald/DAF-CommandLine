# DAF-CommandLine
Command line version of a DAF tool, useful for fixing speech impediments.

Uses <a href="https://github.com/naudio/NAudio">Naudio</a> to play a delayed input from a microphone.
Recommended delay is between 50 and 250 ms.
It is also recommended to check with a speech-language pathologist if this will actually benefit you.

I made this since there was no decent free alternative on windows.

Usage:
Run DAF.exe and enter desired delay.
